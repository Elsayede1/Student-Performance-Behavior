# *📌 Project Overview*
This project analyzes student performance and behavior using a dataset containing grades, attendance, and personal attributes. The goal is to uncover key factors influencing academic success and develop predictive models to identify at-risk students.
# *📂 Dataset*
* Source: Kaggle - [Students Grading Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudelhemaly/students-grading-dataset)
* Features: Student ID, grades, attendance, participation, social factors, and more
* Objective: Explore relationships between behavior, study habits, and performance
# *🔍 Key Analysis & Features*
✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Visualizing trends, correlations, outliers)
✔ Statistical Insights (Understanding impact of attendance, participation, and social aspects)
✔ Machine Learning Models (Predicting student performance using regression & classification models)
✔ Interactive Dashboards (Visualizing insights with Plotly & Dash)
# *🛠 Tech Stack*
Languages: Python, SQL
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash
# *📈 Results & Insights*
Attendance and participation significantly impact final grades.
Certain social and behavioral factors correlate with academic performance.
Machine learning models can effectively predict student success and identify at-risk students.
